# Data Understanding and Preparation
##### Ques.
How to solve business problems using data analysis?
##### Ans.
The structure for analytics problem solving is called the CRISP-DM framework - Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining.

It involves a series of steps :-
Business understanding
Data understanding
Data Preparation
Data Modelling
Model Evaluation
Model Deployment


##### Ques. 
How to understand business problem?
##### Ans.
To understand the business problem:-

Determine the business objectives clearly
Determine the goals of data analysis 

##### Ques. 
Data Understanding ?
##### Ans.
The type of data sets that are available for analysis
The information you can get from the datasets
Exploring the data (by plotting graphs and observing them)
Performing quality checks on the data sets


##### Ques. 
Data Preparation ?
##### Ans.
Data preparation consists of the following steps:

Select relevant data
Integrate data
Clean data
Construct Data: Derive new features
Format Data

##### Ques.
Data Modelling?
##### Ans.
Modelling is the heart of data analytics. One can think of a model as a black box which takes relevant data as input and gives an output you are interested in.

##### Ques.
Model Evaluation and Deployment?
##### Ans.
##### Evaluation
The predictive models can be tested to assess their effectiveness in solving the problem. This is the fifth
stage of the framework â€“ model evaluation. Modelling and evaluation together is an iterative process in
which the models are tweaked until satisfactory evaluation results are obtained.
###### Deployment
This is the last stage of the framework, where the model is translated into a business strategy. Business data
is fed into the model and the model results are used to inform business decisions on an on-going basis.
